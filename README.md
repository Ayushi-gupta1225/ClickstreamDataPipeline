# ClickstreamDataPipeline

## Overview:
This project aims to develop a clickstream data pipeline using Scala and Spark, integrating with MySQL database and creating visualizations using Tableau for insightful dashboards. The pipeline is built using Agile methodology for modularization of code and includes unit testing and configuration files for robustness and scalability.

## Features:
1. *Data Collection:* 
   - Clickstream data is collected from various sources and stored in MySQL database.
   - Scala Spark is used for efficient data processing and manipulation.

2. *Data Pipeline:*
   - Spark streaming is employed for real-time data processing of clickstream events.
   - Various transformations and aggregations are performed to extract valuable insights from the raw data.

3. *Integration with MySQL:*
   - MySQL database is used as the backend storage for the clickstream data.
   - Scala code interacts with the MySQL database for data retrieval and storage.

4. *Visualization with Tableau:*
   - Tableau is utilized for creating interactive and insightful dashboards.
   - Dashboards provide visual representation of key metrics and trends derived from the clickstream data.

5. *Modularization and Agile Methodology:*
   - Agile methodology is followed for iterative development and continuous integration.
   - Codebase is modularized for better maintainability, scalability, and reusability.

6. *Unit Testing:*
   - Unit tests are implemented using ScalaTest framework to ensure the correctness and reliability of the code.
   - Tests cover various aspects of the data pipeline, including data processing, transformations, and integration with MySQL.

7. *Configuration Files:*
   - Configuration files are used to manage environment-specific parameters and settings.
   - This ensures flexibility and ease of deployment across different environments.

## Usage:
1. *Setup Environment:*
   - Install Scala, Spark, MySQL, and Tableau as per the system requirements.
   - Configure the necessary dependencies and libraries in the project.

2. *Run the Application:*
   - Execute the main Scala Spark application to start the data pipeline.
   - Monitor the data processing and ensure smooth execution.

3. *Visualize Data:*
   - Use Tableau to connect to the MySQL database and create dashboards.
   - Explore the visualizations to gain insights into clickstream behavior and patterns.
